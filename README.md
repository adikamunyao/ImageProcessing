# Ultrasound Image Classification: Automating Analysis with Machine Learning
This project explores the exciting potential of machine learning (ML) for automated ultrasound image analysis, focusing on both hearts (echocardiography) and abdomens.

## Project Goals:
1. Develop robust classifiers to differentiate between heart and abdominal ultrasounds using image features.
2. Leverage Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for accurate image classification.
3. Employ image preprocessing techniques to enhance data quality and model performance.
4. Ultimately, revolutionize medical imaging with automated analysis and classification tools.

### Benefits:
* Streamline diagnostic processes for medical professionals.
* Pave the way for advancements in medical research.

## Dataset:
A rich collection of ultrasound images:
* 218 four-chamber heart ultrasounds
* 925 abdominal ultrasounds (source to be added)

### Success Metrics:
* **Precision:** Measures the model's accuracy in identifying true positives (correctly classified ultrasounds).
* **Recall (Sensitivity):** Evaluates the model's ability to capture all relevant images within a specific class.
* **F1 Score:** Provides a balanced view of both precision and recall, crucial for imbalanced datasets.

This project holds immense potential to transform medical imaging by introducing efficient and powerful ML-driven analysis tools.
